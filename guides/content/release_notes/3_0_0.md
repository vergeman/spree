### Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce

With the change to [enhanced ecommerce](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce) tracking you should make sure to [upgrade your Google Analytics account to Universal Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/upgrade/reference/gajs-analyticsjs#overview).  If you use Spree's default google analytics implementation you should be fine, but if you've customized these make sure to update to [Universal Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/).
